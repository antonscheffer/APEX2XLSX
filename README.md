# APEX2XLSX
Oracle APEX plugin to export a report to Excel xlsx<br/>
In it's current state if offers more functionality than the old <a href=" http://www.apex-plugin.com/oracle-apex-plugins/process-type-plugin/ir-report-to-excel-xlsx_74.html">(IR) Report to Excel (xlsx)</a>, such as handling bind variables.
I'm still working on it, so it is not yet released to the public
