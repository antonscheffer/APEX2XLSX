# APEX2XLSX
Oracle APEX plugin to export a report to Excel xlsx
In it's current state if offers more functionality than the old (IR) Report to Excel (xlsx) plugin http://www.apex-plugin.com/oracle-apex-plugins/process-type-plugin/ir-report-to-excel-xlsx_74.html , such as handling bind variables.
I'm still working on it, so it is not yet released to the public
